# Hi, I’m Saad Kashif Qureshi

I’m a developer who loves building intelligent systems and exploring how software, hardware, and AI can work together.  
My interests include AI, machine learning, full-stack web and mobile development, cybersecurity, and game development.  
I work with frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and tools such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, and Transformers.  
Right now, I’m focused on Project Jarses, a long-term research project about ethical AI, automation, and human and AI collaboration through exoskeletons and AR/VR systems.

# Project Jarses

Project Jarses is an ambitious research and development initiative focused on creating an AI assistant and integrated exoskeleton ecosystem inspired by next-generation human-AI collaboration concepts. The goal is to design an intelligent personal system capable of advanced automation, data analysis, holographic visualization, and physical augmentation through robotics and wearable technology.

## Vision

To develop an ethical, autonomous, and locally deployable AI that can act as a personal assistant, engineer, and companion system—bridging software intelligence with hardware reality. The system will be trained and fine-tuned ethically with transparency in data and behavior, aiming to surpass existing closed AI models in both efficiency and responsibility.

## Core Objectives

- Build an adaptive AI core for real-time data processing, decision making, and multimodal communication.  
- Design a holographic or AR interface for natural, immersive interaction.  
- Develop IoT and exoskeleton integration to extend physical capabilities.  
- Integrate medical monitoring and emergency-response systems.  
- Enable modular extensions for home automation, cybersecurity, and education.

## Technical Components

- **AI Backend:** Python, LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API (transitioning to a self-trained local model).  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Jetson Nano, exoskeleton frame with servo actuation.  
- **Simulation:** Unity, Unreal Engine, MATLAB/Simulink, ROS.  
- **Visualization:** AR/VR holographic UI with gesture and voice controls.  
- **Security:** AES encryption, locally stored data, no third-party tracking.

## Ethical AI Development

Project Jarses will initially rely on OpenAI APIs for prototyping. However, the long-term plan is to migrate to a privately trained model running on locally owned hardware. The model will be developed with strict ethical training datasets and oversight to ensure privacy, security, and shari’a-compliant standards.

## Research Modules

1. AI Assistant and Automation  
2. Exoskeleton Design and Control Systems  
3. AI Medical Diagnostics and Vital Monitoring  
4. Holographic/AR UI and Visualization  
5. Cybersecurity and Ethical AI Governance  

---

## Collaboration Goals

Looking for contributors in the following domains:  
- AI and Machine Learning engineers  
- Robotics and Mechanical engineers  
- AR/VR developers  
- Data Scientists and IoT specialists  
- Ethical AI researchers and Islamic tech advisors  

---

## Future Roadmap

- Prototype the AI assistant core.  
- Develop holographic UI simulation.  
- Integrate IoT and medical monitoring.  
- Build and test a lightweight exoskeleton frame.  
- Transition AI from OpenAI API to a self-trained local inference engine.  

---

## Licensing and Usage

Open collaboration is encouraged. All development must respect privacy, ethical research, and lawful usage.
